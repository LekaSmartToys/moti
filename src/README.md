#Moti Source Code

##About

Here you can find the code you need to upload to your robot to make it work. The code is designed to work with _our_ prototype. If you are using a different Arduino card or different sensors version, you may need to adapt the code to suit your specific needs.

If you are planning on making some pull request later, you should consider using the exact same hardware (or a better one) to develop the project.
