### ATTENTION
### This is an example Makefile and it MUST be configured to suit your needs.

### the boardtag represents the board you're currently using. select the right one (uno, mega2560, etc.)
BOARD_TAG         = uno

### don't change this, our Serial communication are always using the 115200 baudrate
MONITOR_BAUDRATE  = 115200

### path to where you cloned the moti repository
PROJECT_DIR       = /Users/Ladislas/dev/leka/moti

### this is the path to the Arduino-Makefile directory.
ARDMK_DIR         = $(PROJECT_DIR)/arduino-makefile

### path to the Arduino.app directory.
### or linux, use something like:
### ARDUINO_DIR   = /usr/share/arduino
ARDUINO_DIR       = /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java

### path to avr-gcc and co.
### for linux, just use:
### AVR_TOOLS_DIR = /usr
### because it adds the rest (like "/bin")
AVR_TOOLS_DIR     = /usr/local

### your path to avrdude. if you used homebrew, it should be something like that
AVRDDUDE          = /usr/local/bin/avrdude

### connect your arduino, open the IDE and look for the port
MONITOR_PORT      = /dev/tty.usbmodemfa131

### don't touch this
CURRENT_DIR       = $(shell basename $(CURDIR))

### path to Arduino.mk, inside the ARDMK_DIR, don't touch.
include $(ARDMK_DIR)/arduino-mk/Arduino.mk
