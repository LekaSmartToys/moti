Designing Moti
==============


Software
--------

###3D Models
To visualize and edit the 3D models, you need to have [Catia](http://www.3ds.com/products/catia/) installed on your computer.


###Moti
To visualize the Arduino design of Moti, you need to download & install [Fritzing]() for your platform. Fritzing is a great tool for designing and for sharing your sketches, connections and so on.


###PCB
To visualize the PCB files, you need to download & install [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/). It is highly recommended to copy in a safe place on your hard drive because sometimes, just opening them can cause gruesome errors in the PCB.


Bill of Material
----------------

Because we think that being able to build your own Moti is the best way to improve it, we've made available all the components we use for our Moti.
All of them can be purchased at [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/), [DFRobot](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php) or [RobotShop](http://www.robotshop.com/).
Feel free to notify us if you find cheaper retailers in your country, we'll add them to the list! :)
