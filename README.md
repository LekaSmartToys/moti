#Moti Readme


##About

Moti is a new kind of interactive smart toy: it's a spherical robot specially designed for children with autism.


##Why Github?

Because our team is not located in one single place, we needed a way to distribute the process of prototyping so that everyone could try it at home, debug it and create new features.

At first, we wanted to keep the code for ourselves. But then we thought "hey! our project is great, but wouldn't it be better if a lot of people could fork it, add their modifications, features, improvements, and then share it back to the community?"

For us, the answer is an absolute YES! We want people to be able to look at our code, use it for their projects, use it to build their own Moti and then get back to us to improve the awesomeness for a better world today!


##Actual Version

The actual development version is v1.0, but it hasn't been pushed on Github yet.

The working version is 0.1 - please note that this was our first prototype. Due to heavy development we are going a little faster than we thought and we are now developing a new version with different components.

The new v1.0 version is a little more expensive than v0.1, so do not hesitate to fork the master branch tagged 0.1 to continue the development of v0.1 cheaper version.


##Branches

*	master is the stable branch for production and tests.
*	dev (origin HEAD) is the development branch for unit/lab tests and behaviour development. if the lab tests are concluding, a pull request to the master can be made.
*	feature branches are transitory branches used to develop new features to incorporate to the dev branch. when the feature is bugless, a pull request may be made to merge the concluding results inside the dev branch.


##Toolbox

###Basic

To help us develop our product, you'll first need to different softwares:

*	[Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software) - this software is used to develop the source code and to upload it to your Arduino board. We recommend going for the 1.0.5 version. If you are a little more advanced user feel free to try the new beta version 1.5. Please note that you may encounter strange behaviors (we do sometimes), so please, take the time to report them in the [Due Forum](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?board=87.0) and/or here.
*	[Processing IDE](http://www.processing.org/download/) - this software is an incredible tool to create GUI from scratch. Besides Moti, we are developing a GUI to debug and analyze data. You can find the [Moti Processing App here](https://github.com/WeAreLeka/moti-processing-app). As for the Arduino IDE, we are using the latest beta. Sometimes everything works find, sometimes there are some bugs. Restarting your computer can be a good solution.
*	[Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Of course, you need to have git install but we assume that if you are reading this, you know what it is and how to use it. If you're not really comfortable with the Terminal, you can use a Git GUI. [Try this list](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac), test them and stick to the one you prefer! :)
*	[Github account](https://github.com/signup/free) - Sign up for free, fork the project, improve the awesomeness and pull it back!

With these softwares, you should be up and running and ready to hack autism with Moti!


###Advanced

Okay, so you started with the Arduino and Processing IDE, you're now familiarized with the languages, you've already read and write something like a thousand lines of code and you would really love some new tools to speed up your coding and improve your coding experience. Here are some solutions for you that we, at Leka, are using on a daily basis with great pleasure!

*	[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) - ST2 is our favorite code editor. It takes some time to familiarize but once you get used to it, you'll have some hard time finding a replacement! The great thing with ST2 is that you can install or develop your own packages to improve your coding experience. Here after are some of theme :)
*	[ST2 Package Controler](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) - First start with this one! It will allow you to manage and install great packages. Follow the instruction provided by the link and your good to go!
*	[Arduino-like IDE](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino) - This package allow you to develop the Arduino code and upload it to your robot directly from within ST2. Everything is very well explained on their Github. If you are having some troubles, give us a call or contact them directly.
*	[Processing-like IDE](https://github.com/b-g/processing-sublime) - Same as above but for Processing!


##Installing & Updating

Note: Make sure Git and cURL are installed.

For the project, we use different libraries. Some of them are public, well-known libraries from the Arduino website and some are custom made to suit our needs.
If you want to be able to compile the project, you need to have our libraries inside your library folder so they can be accessed by the Arduino app.
[By following this link](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries), you'll know here to find yours depending on your OS: Windows or a UNIX based system (OS X, Linux, Debian, etc.)

###Stable on Linux/Unix based systems using make install

####Installing

The following instructions should work on Mac OS X, Debian, Ubuntu, etc. (We haven't tested it yet, if you do, contact us!)

The easiest way is to use Git and make for installing:

	$ git clone https://github.com/WeAreLeka/moti.git
	$ cd YOUR/PATH/TO/moti/
	$ git checkout dev # or master for working versions
	$ make install

Basically it just makes symlinks from ./lib to ./Arduino/libraries. Make sure you don't already have a library with the same name, it can cause troubles. Plus, we may have made some changes to the libraries, so it's better to use our versions.


####Updating

Updating using git:

	$ git pull
	$ make update

Use update when new libraries are added.


##How to use

"Okay, I've cloned the repo, installed all the softwares, but I'm quite new to Arduino and I don't know what to do!" - That's all right! You might not be a geek like us, but you will be sooner than you think.

Here are some things to do for your robot to start living :

1.	Visit our [Bill of Material page](sketch/README.md) and buy the different parts from your favorite retailer.
1.	Wait a couple of days for the mailman.
1.	Build the robot, yeah!
1.	Connect the Arduino board to your computer using the usb cable.
1.	Open the Arduino IDE or ST2.
1.	Open the project.
1.	Go to src/moti_1 or src/moti_2 (depending on the robot you're building) and open moti_1.ino or moti_2.ino (or any version we might be developing in the future!).
1.	Upload the sketch to the Arduino board. The way of doing this will depend on the software you're using. We advise you to read the necessary documentation.
1.	Enjoy! :)


##Known Issues

###Moti 2 - v1.0

*	none yet (we're so cool!)

###Moti 1 - v0.1

*	the speed and the light depend on the excitement of the robot, but when the motors are running, moti is exciting itself perpetually... need to change that!


##Uninstalling

###Linux/Unix based OS

To remove all the libraries used for the Moti project, simply run:

	$ git pull
	$ make uninstall

The uninstaller is clever! You don't need to worry about your own libraries being removed, only our libraries are targeted and removed.


##TODO

*	Implement the todo list...

##Leka would like to thank

Our team would like to thank with all our hearts [Vincent Thiberville](http://www.vincent-thiberville.com/) for his kind work on our first prototype.
Without him nothing would have been possible!
