Moti Readme
===========


About
-----

Because our team is not located in one single place, we needed a way to distribute the process of prototyping so that everyone could try it at home, debug it and create new features.

At first, we wanted to keep the code for ourselves. But then we thought "hey! our project is great, but wouldn't it be better if a lot of people could fork it, add their modifications, features, improvements, and then share it back to the community?"

For us, the answer is an absolute YES! We want people to be able to look at our code, use it for their projects, use it to build their own Moti and then get back to us to improve the awesomeness for a better world today!


Branches
------------

*	master is the stable branch for production and tests on the children.
*	dev (origin HEAD) is the development branch for unit/lab tests and behaviour development. if the lab tests are concluding, a pull request to the master can be made.
*	feature branches are transitory branches used to develop new features to incorporate to the dev branch. when the feature is bugless, a pull request may be made to merge the concluding results inside the dev branch.


Known Issues
------------

*	none yet (we're so cool!) - just kidding!
*	the speed and the light depend on the excitement of the robot, but when the motors are running, moti is exciting itself perpetually... need to change that!


Installing & Updating
---------------------

Note: Make sure Git and cURL are installed.

For the project, we use different libraries. Some of them are public, well-known libraries from the Arduino website and some are custom made to suit our needs.
If you want to be able to compile the project, you need to have our libraries inside your library folder so they can be accessed by the Arduino app.
[By following this link](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries), you'll know here to find yours depending on your OS: Windows or a UNIX based system (OS X, Linux, Debien, etc.)

###Stable on Linux/Unix based systems using make install####

####Installing

The following instructions should work on Mac OS X, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

The easiest way is to use Git and make for installing:

	$ git clone https://github.com/WeAreLeka/moti.git
	$ cd YOUR/PATH/TO/moti/
	$ git checkout dev // or master
	$ make install

Basically it just makes symlinks from ./lib to ./Arduino/libraries. Make sure you don't already have a library with the same name, it can cause troubles.

####Updating

Updating using git

	$ git pull
	$ make update


Uninstalling 
------------

###Linux/Unix based OS

To remove all the libraries used for the Moti project, simply run:
	
	$ git pull
	$ make uninstall

The uninstaller is clever! You don't need to worry about your own libraries being removed, only our libraries are targeted and removed.


Leka would like to thank
------------------------

Our team would like to thank with all our hearts [Vincent Thiberville](http://www.vincent-thiberville.com/) for his kind work on our first prototype.
Without him nothing would have been possible!
